I would like to take this opportunity to express my most sincere gratitude to my advisor Dr. Satyajayant (Jay) Misra, without his immense cooperation, vast knowledge and continuous support this research work would not have been complete. He has been like a father figure to me and has encouraged me continuously. He has been a role model for me and has taught me almost everything during my master’s study. \par
I would like to thank Dr. David Mitchell, my committee member for his constant motivation and technical support during my research work. I am highly indebted to Dr. Jonathan Cook for being part of my defense committee in spite of his busy schedule. I would like to express my deep gratitude to Reza Tourani and Travis Mick for their great help and support during the whole period of research work. \par
I would also like to convey my immense indebtedness to my parents, Mukund Parikh and Geeta Parikh who have encouraged me and inspired me to be a better human being throughout my life. Their constant encouragement towards pursuing a higher education degree has urged me to successfully complete my master’s education and research work. \par
A life without friends is like a vehicle with no wheels. I would like to take this opportunity to convey my immense gratitude to all my friends who have helped me during this important course of my life.\par
